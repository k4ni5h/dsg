For given problem my final solution is in result.txt file on running result.py file.

Let give data to analyze as DA
Let give data to test as DB

Steps to get the final result:-
Step 1 : What I get between e/p in DB if all matters equally DA by simple probability rule (specific equal cases for others and for int 1/(x-x1)^2).
Step 2 : By above method I got 90.36% exact solution in DA if i verify the answer from the provided data DA.
Step 3 : Then I found which value matter to how much extent by giving rewards to supproting factor and penalize if it is non-supportive value.
Step 4 : This time the probability reaches to 99.26%.
Step 5 : After 2-3 iterations, I got nearly 99.30%.
Step 6 : I use it in my result.py and get corresponding result.txt.
